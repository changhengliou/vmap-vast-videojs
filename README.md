<h1>VAMP-VAST-VIDEOJS</h1>

This repo includes a vast parser, vmap parser and a partially working file handles vmap and vast ad response.
In the repo, I use google IMA sample tags as a test, and it does work for linear pre-roll ad and 1 pre-roll ad and 3 mid-roll ad.
    
There are still many features that are not currently be implemented. For example, for now only companion ad and linear ad
are supported. NonLinear ad is not supported yet. And user-trackings and many other features are also not implemented.

To run this, please do:
<code>
    yarn install & yarn run test
</code>

<b>This is an experiment project, but still, any suggestions are welcome.</b>
